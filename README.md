SScript Compiler
----------------

### Description
It's a simple SScript (my language) compiler, written mainly for fun and to use in my future projects (but you can use it too, if you want) :)

### Downloading
There are 2 branches:

-master (this is the "live" version of code - it's untested and most likely unstable; use only if you know what are you doing)

-stable (this is the latest stable and tested version of code; also - it has compiled binaries)

### Contributing
You want to contribute? It's great :)


You can contribute in 2 ways:

1.By reporting an issue or suggestion (and then me or somebody else will try to fix/add it)

2.By writing/fixing already written code; if you don't know how, read an article, eg.http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2010/contributing-to-projects-on-github


Thanks for help!
